## Dread Engine Mk1
My first attempt at creating a custom renderer. It is an OpenGL based renderer with simple OBJ loading and 2 set lighting sources.

## Dread Engine Mk2
Second attempt at a custom renderer. It was an exercise in improving my code readability. I does however have less functionality than the first it was a good experience.

## Dread Engine Mk3
Third attempt at a custom renderer with a specific purpose. My aim was to make a game using my own renderer with basic shape collisions. I was able to render 2 shapes in different colors then I stopped development on it. I should finish it.
