## Description
- Genre: Single player, brawler
- Engine: Unity
- Language: C#
- Platform: Windows

I worked on a solo fighting game set in an underground lizard arena. My job was to make the enemy lizards smart. It was awesome learning how to use a finite state machine to control their behavior. I had to balance their aggression while making them look like they were picking their targets wisely to attack.
