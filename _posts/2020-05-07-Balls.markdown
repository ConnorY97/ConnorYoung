My attempt at making popular mobile game [Ballz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.ballz&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1). I am also using it as my guinea pig for getting my GitHub build actions working. Which means the master branch is getting flooded with commits which have little to do with the actual game development.

The hope is to have a branch dedicated to build and development but that is still to come.

You should also be able to play the game here:
