Golem is a relaxing, atmospheric puzzle game about a Golem. From a third-person perspective, you play as a rock golem who comes to life in an ancient Aztec ruin and must solve puzzles to find a way out, bringing life to the overgrown ruins as you explore. The game play revolves around the golem's ability to detach their head from their body, which unlocks a range of abilities â€“ most interaction is done using the body, while most exploration is done using the head.
