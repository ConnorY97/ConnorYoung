## Description
- Genre: Single player, brawler
- Engine: Unity
- Language: C#
- Platform: Windows

A single player brawl, set in an underground lizard battle ring. My role in this project was to create the AI for the enemy lizards. It was a great learning experience, using a finite state machine to control the behavior of the AI. This was done to balance itâ€™s aggression while also making it appear to intelligently select targets to attack.
