GitHub provides a powerful CI tool in the form of actions. This are process you can define to do a range of things!

I have only used them for Unity builds so far, but I am currently testing uploading a build project to ItchIO. The hope is I can have a build branch for my Unity projects that I will easily be able to update and have my games accessible for anyone to test for me without them having to download anything!

The next thing I hope to look into is some sort of code review for commits I make. I am not sure whether this is going to involve some sort of AI but it will be exciting to test!
