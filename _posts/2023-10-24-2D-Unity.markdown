Title: 2D Unity

Practicing different forms of AI in a 2D Unity Environment.

This started with [Conway's Game of Life](https://blog.yarsalabs.com/conways-game-of-life-in-unity/) and now working on a [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) algorithm from old Uni exercises.

Conway's is currently working, though it does start to throttle after adding 150 x 150 tiles.

I have just implemented the fleeing behavior for the Boids. The hope is to either add some fishy sprites and put them in some sort of fish tank.

Finally, I will work on an A* algorithm to recreate the hedge maze from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

Lots to do. Testing webhooks! New test
