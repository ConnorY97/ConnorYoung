# Our First Game Jam
I participated in the [Itch.io Mini Jam 160](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-160-light) with [Alex](https://github.com/AlexMollard) and [Reyhan](https://github.com/Dyfust).

Reyhan and I came up with the idea for defend the light using Samsung notes and some scribbles. The theme was `Light` and the limitation was `Speed is Key`. So the idea of protecting the light producing birds from demon dogs just made sense.

### Roles
I acted a game design lead, and Reyhan and Alex were both primarily programmers. Alex did a lot of the beatifying of the final game as well. We all only had a few hours here and there to work on the project so I am very happy with how it turned out. I would like to come back to this project in the future to iron out some of the kinks.

### What went wrong
Not having a lot of time impacted the scope of the game massively and what we were able to work on. Not having an artist meant I had to grab a lot of assets from the Unity store. Finally, when trying to implement a second camera to make sure the scary face was always visible, I managed to break the whole game. I was then able to go back through the repository to find the break and revert it.

### What to do next time
Try find a jam that we are all more available for. Maybe trying to find an artist, and implement some more checking so I don't break the project just before launch.

### The project
