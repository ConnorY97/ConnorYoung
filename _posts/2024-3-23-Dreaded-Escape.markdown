JOLLY COLLABORATION!

Working with [Alex](https://github.com/AlexMollard), [Declan](https://github.com/DeclanRogers) and myself.

We are going to work on a horror puzzle game in UE3. This is just a chance for all of us to work on our UE5 skills as we all have been primarily Custom Engine or Unity devs.

I have some experience with UE from work but it is in a very limited capacity, this will be the first time I make a personal project/game in UE.
